<----------------- [ Additional Elements ] ------------------>
Load balancer:
	A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers,
	preventing any single server from becoming overloaded.
	This improves responsiveness and overall system availability.

Multiple web servers, application servers, and database servers:
	By having multiple instances of these servers, the load is shared, improving
	scalability and redundancy.
	If one server fails, the others can handle the traffic.


<----------------- [ Load Balancer Distribution Algorithm ] ------------------>
Round Robin:
	Distributes requests evenly across all available servers, sending each
	request to the next server in line.
	This is a simple and effective approach for most scenarios.

Least Connections:
	Directs requests to the server with the fewest current connections.
	This ensures a more balanced distribution of workload and can improve
	performance.


<-----------------[ Active-Active vs Active-Passive ] --------------------->
The infrastructure implemeted in the image above is active-active.
Active-Active:
	Distributes traffic across all available servers simultaneously.
	This provides high availability and redundancy, as any server can handle
	requests if another fails.

Active-Passive:
	Only one server is actively processing requests (active), while the others
	are passive backups.
	If the active server fails, a passive server is automatically activated to take over.
	This is simpler to manage but offers less redundancy compared to active-active.


<------------------------[ Database Primary-Replica Cluster ] ------------------------->
A database primary-replica (master-slave) cluster consists of two or more servers:
	Primary node (master):
		Receives all write requests from the application server and updates the
		database.

	Replica nodes (slaves):
		Continuously replicate data from the primary node, ensuring they have an
		up-to-date copy of the database.


<------------------------[ Issues ] ------------------------->
SPOF (Single Point of Failure):
	Load balancer:
		If the load balancer fails, no traffic will be distributed to the
		servers.

	Database primary node:
		If the primary database node fails in a primary-replica cluster without
		a configured failover mechanism, the application may not function
		correctly.

Security Issues:
	No firewall:
		A firewall acts as a security barrier, filtering incoming and outgoing
		traffic based on predefined security rules.
		Without a firewall, the system is vulnerable to malicious attacks.

	No HTTPS:
		Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) encrypts communication
		between the web server and the client's browser.
		This protects sensitive data like usernames and passwords from being
		intercepted.

Missing Monitoring:
	The image doesn't show any monitoring system.
	Monitoring is crucial for identifying and troubleshooting issues before they
	impact users.
	A monitoring system can track server performance, application errors, and
	resource utilization.
