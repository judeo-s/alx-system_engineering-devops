Load balancers:
The addition of load balancers working in a cluster adds benefits to the infrastructure
by:
	Increased Scalability:
		A single load balancer can become a bottleneck if it receives a high volume
		of traffic.
		By using a cluster of load balancers, you can distribute traffic across multiple
		devices, improving the infrastructure's ability to handle surges in traffic.
		This allows the system to scale horizontally by adding more load balancers as needed.

	Improved Availability and Fault Tolerance:
		If a single load balancer fails in a cluster, the other load balancers can continue
		to distribute traffic, minimizing downtime and ensuring service continuity.
		wThis redundancy helps achieve high availability for your web application.
