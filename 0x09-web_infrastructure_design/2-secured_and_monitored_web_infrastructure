<-------------------------[ Additional Elements ] ------------------------->
Firewalls:
	Firewalls act as security barriers, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic
	based on predefined rules.
	They help protect the infrastructure from various cyberattacks by blocking
	malicious traffic and only allowing authorized connections.

Monitoring Solutions:
	Monitoring solutions are crucial for proactively identifying and
	troubleshooting issues before they impact users.
	They can track various metrics, including server performance, application
	errors, resource utilization, and network traffic.

Web Server with SSL:
	Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts communication between the web server and
	the user's browser.
	This encrypts sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and other
	information transmitted during web sessions, safeguarding it from
	eavesdropping or tampering.
	HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) refers to HTTP traffic encrypted
	with SSL/TLS.


<----------[ Why HTTPS and Terminating SSL at Load Balancer ]---------->
HTTPS:
	Implementing HTTPS with SSL/TLS encryption is essential for securing
	communication between the web server and the client.
	It protects sensitive user data and ensures the integrity of the data being
	exchanged.

Terminating SSL at Load Balancer:
	Terminating SSL at the load balancer can improve performance by offloading
	encryption/decryption tasks from web servers.


<-------------------------[ Monitoring Solution ] ------------------------->
Monitoring is used for proactively identifying and troubleshooting issues before
they impact users and infrastructure as a whole.

Monitoring tools collect data by:
	Agent-Based Monitoring:
		Agent softwares are installed directly on the servers.
		These agents collect data locally and send it to the central monitoring
		system

	SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol):
		SNMP monitoring collects status, health, and performance data from
		network devices.
		It uses SNMP agents installed on servers to query information from
		managed devices like routers, switches, and server.

Ways to monitor web server QPS:
	Server-side monitoring tools:
		These tools can be installed directly on the web server to track metrics
		like QPS, response times, and resource usage.

	Cloud-based monitoring services:
		These services offer comprehensive monitoring solutions, often including
		QPS monitoring.

	Log analysis tools:
		These tools can analyze web server logs to extract QPS data.
		They typically require additional configuration to parse logs and calculate QPS.


<-------------------------[ Issues ] ------------------------->
Terminating SSL at the load balancer:
	The load balancer would need to possess the private key required for
	decryption, which introduces a security risk if the load balancer is
	compromised.

Single MySQL Server Write Point:
	Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a Single
	Point of Failure (SPOF).
	If this server fails, the application may not function correctly as it won't
	be able to write data to the database.

Homogeneous Servers:
	Having all servers with the same components (database, web server, and
	application server) can be a disadvantage.
	If a vulnerability affects one component, all servers might be susceptible.
